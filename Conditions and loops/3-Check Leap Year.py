# How to determine if a year is a leap year?
# If a year is evenly divisible by 4 means having no remainder then go to next step. If it is not divisible by 4. It is not a leap year. For example: 1997 is not a leap year.
# If a year is divisible by 4, but not by 100. For example: 2012, it is a leap year. If a year is divisible by both 4 and 100, go to next step.
# If a year is divisible by 100, but not by 400. For example: 1900, then it is not a leap year. If a year is divisible by both, then it is a leap year. So 2000 is a leap year.





# Code
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))  
if (year % 4) == 0:  
   if (year % 100) == 0:  
       if (year % 400) == 0:  
           print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))  
       else:  
           print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))  
   else:  
       print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))  
else:  
   print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
